        <div id="item2">Bollywood (likely the most familiar word on this site) is the Hindi film industry, based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. The word is a mashup of "Bombay" (the previous name of Mumbai) and "Hollywood." In 1913, the first Bollywood movie was released, and it was also India's first feature film. Unlike Tollywood and Kollywood, which are somewhat localized to their parent states, the Hindi-speaking population is widespread across most North Indian states, making it an influential industry in those states too. Attracting such a large audience and actors from all backgrounds, Bollywood puts out the most movies in a year compared to any Indian movie industry and have a decent worldwide reach.</div>
        <div id="item3">Hindi cinema is made up of eras, with famous actors having their own peak decades (but still having successes otherwise). Perhaps the most famous Indian actor of all time is Amitabh Bachchan, who had his peak in the 70s and 80s. Before him were actors like Raj Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, and Rajesh Khanna. Like Tollywood, Bollywood also has actor families, such as at least three sets of Kapoors and the Bachchans. The 90s saw the rise of the Khans: Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Shahrukh Khan. They peaked in the 90s and the 00s, especially Shahrukh, who is the most famous Bollywood actor after Amitabh. Then came actors like Hrithik Roshan, Shahid Kapoor, and Ranveer Singh. There was another influx of actors in the 10s, and more actors continue to be introduced every month, because it is the dream of many to someday be a movie star.</div>

        <div id="item6">The most common type of Bollywood movie is known as a "masala" film. Such movies combine all genres, like romance, action, tragedy, and so on. Since this is such a common type of film that will appeal to fans across preferences, many mainstream Bollywood movies can become predictable in their plot and structure, despite still being good movies. However, there has been a growing market for more offbeat movies starring lesser-known stars, which gain critical acclaim but sometimes do not land well with the audience. With a generally conservative audience, it is also hard to tread on sensitive topics, but large strides are being made in the industry for inclusion and diversity year-by-year. Most current actors are very open-minded and enjoy doing a variety of movies, rather than the same story revamped over and over.</div>
        <div id="item7">Every Bollywood movie has at least one song. Older Bollywood songs, whether based on traditional North Indian music or not, are generally a bit slow by today's standards. One of the most famous Bollywood music directors is R. D. Burman, who composed many songs from the 60s to the 80s. However, in the 80s, new  music directors came in, like Laxmikant-Pyrelal and Kalyanji-Anandji. Then, in the 90s and 00s, Anu Malik and Jatin-Lalit made the songs in the most famous movies. Music directors like Pritam and Vishal-Shekhar shot to fame in the late 00s and the 10s, and continue to compose hit songs today. Unlike Kollywood and Tollywood, Bollywood does not refer to its "mass" as "mass," if that makes sense. That is not really a Bollywood term. Heroes still do have their intro songs in most movies, but  the songs are of a different flavor. This can especially be seen in 90s movies.</div>
